agent: build
---

Based on the user or parent agent request, add a new rule to AGENTS.md that best describes the user's request and the expected behavior of the agent. The rule should be concise, clear, and follow the format of existing rules in AGENTS.md.

When adding a new rule, consider the following:

- The specific action or behavior that the rule is addressing.
- Any constraints or conditions that should be included in the rule.
- The expected outcome or result of following the rule
