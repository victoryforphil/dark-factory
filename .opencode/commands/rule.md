description: Add a new rule to AGENTS.md
agent: build
---

Based on the user or parent agent request, add or update rules in `AGENTS.md` that best describe the expected behavior for future tasks.

When creating or updating a rule, follow this process:

1. Identify the durable behavior behind the request (not a one-off preference).
2. Write a concise rule that matches existing `AGENTS.md` style.
3. Place the rule in the most relevant section of `AGENTS.md`.
4. If the request came from feedback after a miss, ensure the concrete fix is applied first, then codify the rule.
5. Add a short reusable lesson bullet in `docs/lessons/*.lessons.md` when the update should guide future tasks.

When drafting the rule, consider:

- The specific action or behavior that the rule is addressing.
- Any constraints or conditions that should be included in the rule.
- The expected outcome or result of following the rule.
