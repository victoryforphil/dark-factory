# Tutorials

- [Hello Ratatui](./hello-ratatui/): This tutorial takes you through the basics of creating a simple Ratatui application that displays “Hello World”.

- [Counter App](./counter-app/): This tutorial will set up the basics of a `ratatui` project by building an app that displays a counter.

- [JSON Editor](./json-editor/): This tutorial will guide you through setting up a Rust project and organizing its structure for a `ratatui`-based application to edit json key value pairs. JSON Editor TUI will provide an interface for users to input key-value pairs, which are then converted into correct JSON format and printed to stdout.

Note

If you want to jump right into coding yourself, we provide templates for that. See the
[template section](/templates).

We also have some [examples](https://github.com/ratatui/ratatui/tree/main/examples) that might help
you get started on GitHub.

If you are new to terminals, [How Terminals Work](https://how-terminals-work.vercel.app/) overview
is a good place to start.

Note

You can also check out [videos](/tutorials/videos) created by Ratatui users.
