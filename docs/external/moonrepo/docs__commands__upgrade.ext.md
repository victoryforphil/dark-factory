# upgrade

The `moon upgrade` command can be used to upgrade your current moon binary (if installed globally)
to the latest version.

```
$ moon upgrade
```

caution

This command will only work if moon was installed in the `~/.moon` directory, using our official
[installation script](/docs/install). If installed through Node.js, you'll need to upgrade manually.
