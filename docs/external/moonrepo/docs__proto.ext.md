# What is proto?

3 min

proto is a pluggable version manager, a unified toolchain.

If you're unfamiliar with the concept of a toolchain, a toolchain is a collection of tools that are
downloaded, installed, and managed by version through a single interface. In the context of proto's
toolchain, a tool is either a programming language, a dependency/package manager for a language, or
a custom implementation provided by a plugin. It's the next step in the version manager evolution.

## Features

- Lightspeed! With Rust and WASM, we can guarantee exceptional performance.

- Multi-language. A single CLI for managing versions for all of your languages.

- Cross-platform, for a consistent experience across machines and teams.

- [Contextual version detection](/docs/proto/detection), ensuring the correct version of a tool is always used.

- Checksum verification, ensuring a tool came from a trusted source.

- Detects and infers from a language's ecosystem for maximum compatibility.

- [Pluggable architecture](/docs/proto/plugins), allowing for custom tooling.

## Why proto?

proto was designed to be a modern and holistic version manager for all of your favorite programming
languages. We believe a single tool that works the same across every language is better than
multiple ad-hoc tools. While we only support a handful of languages today, we aim to support many
more in the future!

proto powers [moon](/moon)'s toolchain, enabling a single source of truth for both tools!

## How does it work?

The toolchain is a `.proto` directory within the current user's home directory, e.g., `~/.proto`.

The first step in a tool's life-cycle is being downloaded to `~/.proto/temp`. Downloads are
typically an archive that can be unpacked into a target directory. Once downloaded, we verify the
downloaded file by running a checksum. If this check fails for any reason, the tool is unusable,
and the process is aborted.

After a successful verification, the last step in the tool's life-cycle can begin, installation.
Depending on the type of download, the installation process may differ. For archives, we unpack the
tool to `~/.proto/tools//`. In the future, we'll support building from source.

From here, we make these tools globally available by prepending `~/.proto/shims` and `~/.proto/bin`
to `PATH` (typically as part of your shell profile). Continue reading for more about these folders.

## Supported tools

The following tools are [officially supported](/docs/proto/tools) in proto via moonrepo. Additional
tools can be supported through [third-party plugins](/docs/proto/plugins).

+ npm, pnpm, yarn

+ pip, poetry, uv

... with [0 more proto plugins](/docs/proto/tools#third-party), and over [800 asdf plugins](/docs/proto/tool-spec#asdf)...

## Supported targets

Because proto is written in Rust, we only support targets that are explicitly compiled for, which
are currently:

Operating system Architecture Target

macOS 64-bit Intel `x86_64-apple-darwin`

macOS 64-bit ARM `aarch64-apple-darwin`

Linux 64-bit Intel GNU `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`

Linux 64-bit Intel musl `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl`

Linux 64-bit ARM GNU `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu`

Linux 64-bit ARM musl `aarch64-unknown-linux-musl`

Windows 64-bit Intel `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`
