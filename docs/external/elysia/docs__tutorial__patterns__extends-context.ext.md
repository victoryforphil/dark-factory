# Extends Context

Elysia provides a context with small utilities to help you get started.

You can extends Elysia's context with:

1. Decorate
2. State
3. Resolve
4. Derive

## Decorate

**Singleton**, and **immutable** that shared across all requests.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

class Logger {
    log(value: string) {
        console.log(value)
    }
}

new Elysia()
    .decorate('logger', new Logger())
    .get('/', ({ logger }) => {
        logger.log('hi')

        return 'hi'
    })
```

Decorated value it will be available in the context as a read-only property, see Decorate.

## State

A **mutable** reference that shared across all requests.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
	.state('count', 0)
	.get('/', ({ store }) => {
		store.count++

		return store.count
	})
```

State will be available in **context.store** that is shared across every request, see State.

## Resolve / Derive

Decorate value is registered as a singleton.

While Resolve, and Derive allows you to abstract a context value **per request**.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
	.derive(({ headers: { authorization } }) => ({
		authorization
	}))
	.get('/', ({ authorization }) => authorization)
```

Any **returned value will available in context** except status, which will be send to client directly, and abort the subsequent handlers.

Syntax for both resolve, derive is similar but they have different use cases.

Under the hood, both is a syntax sugar (with type safety) of a lifecycle:

* derive is based on transform
* resolve is based on before handle

Since derive is based on transform means that data isn't validated, and coerce/transform yet. It's better to use resolve if you need a validated data.

## Scope

State, and Decorate are shared across all requests, and instances.

Resolve, and Derive are per request, and has a encapulation scope (as they're based on life-cycle event).

If you want to use a resolved/derived value from a plugin, you would have to declare a Scope.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

const plugin = new Elysia()
	.derive(
		{ as: 'scoped' }, // [!code ++]
		({ headers: { authorization } }) => ({
			authorization
		})
	)

new Elysia()
	.use(plugin)
	.get('/', ({ authorization }) => authorization)
	.listen(3000)
```

## Assignment

Let's try to extends Elysia's context.

\

We can use resolve to extract age from query.

```typescript
import { Elysia, t } from 'elysia'

class Logger {
	log(info: string) {
		console.log(info)
	}
}

new Elysia()
	.decorate('logger', new Logger())
	.onRequest(({ request, logger }) => {
		logger.log(`Request to ${request.url}`)
	})
	.guard({
		query: t.Optional(
			t.Object({
				age: t.Number({ min: 15 })
			})
		)
	})
	.resolve(({ query: { age }, status }) => {
		if(!age) return status(401)

		return { age }
	})
	.get('/profile', ({ age }) => age)
	.listen(3000)
```
