# Lifecycle

Lifecycle **hook** is function that executed on a specific event during the request-response cycle.

They allow you to run custom logic at the certain point

* request - when a request is received
* beforeHandle - before executing a handler
* afterResponse - after a response is sent, etc.
* error - when an error occurs

This can be useful for tasks like logging, authentication, etc.

To register a lifecycle hook, you can pass it to 3rd argument of a route method:

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
	.get('/1', () => 'Hello Elysia!')
	.get('/auth', () => {
		console.log('This is executed after "beforeHandle"')

		return 'Oh you are lucky!'
	}, {
		beforeHandle({ request, status }) {
			console.log('This is executed before handler')

			if(Math.random()  'Hello Elysia!')
```

Here we use `status(418)` which is the "I'm a teapot" status code. You can also use the string name directly: `status("I'm a teapot")`. See Status for more on using status codes.

When `beforeHandle` returns a value, it will skip the handler and return the value instead.

This is useful for things like authentication, where you want to return a `401 Unauthorized` response if the user is not authenticated.

See Life Cycle, Before Handle for a more detailed explanation.

## Hook

A function that intercepts the **lifecycle event**. because a function **"hooks"** into the lifecycle event

Hook can be categorized into 2 types:

1. Local Hook - execute on a specific route
2. Interceptor Hook - execute on every route **after the hook is registered**

## Local Hook

A local hook is executed on a specific route.

To use a local hook, you can inline hook into a route handler:

```typescript
// Similar to previous code snippet
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
	.get('/1', () => 'Hello Elysia!')
	.get('/auth', () => {
		console.log('Run after "beforeHandle"')

		return 'Oh you are lucky!'
	}, {
		// This is a Local Hook
		beforeHandle({ request, status }) {
			console.log('Run before handler')

			if(Math.random()  'Hello Elysia!')
```

## Interceptor Hook

Register hook into every **handler that came after the hook is called** for the current instance only.

To add an interceptor hook, you can use `.on` followed by a lifecycle event:

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
	.get('/1', () => 'Hello Elysia!')
	.onBeforeHandle(({ request, status }) => {
		console.log('This is executed before handler')

		if(Math.random()  {
		console.log('This is executed after "beforeHandle"')

		return 'Oh you are lucky!'
	})
	// "beforeHandle" is also applied
	.get('/2', () => 'Hello Elysia!')
```

Unlike Local Hook, Interceptor Hook will add the hook to every route that came after the hook is registered.

## Assignment

Let's put 2 types of hooks into practice.

\

We can use `beforeHandle` to intercept the request before it reaches the handler, and return a response with `status` method.

```typescript
import { Elysia } from 'elysia'

new Elysia()
	.onBeforeHandle(({ query: { name }, status }) => {
		if(!name) return status(401)
	})
	.get('/auth', ({ query: { name = 'anon' } }) => {
		return `Hello ${name}!`
	})
	.get('/profile', ({ query: { name = 'anon' } }) => {
		return `Hello ${name}!`
	})
	.listen(3000)
```
