# Designer Guardrails (Graph Node TUI)

Use these in every future `@designer` prompt for this thread.

- Monochrome or neutral grays only.
- Boxy terminal look; monospace text.
- No glow, gradient, shadow, blur, or decorative effects.
- No rounded decorative pills unless functionally required.
- Keep connectors simple (`|`, `-`, right-angle routes).
- Prioritize readability and spacing over style polish.
- Sub-agents should be mini boxes/nodes, not fancy badges.
