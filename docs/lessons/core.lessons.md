- Keep this file short and practical: bullets only, target 10-50 lines, always under 100 lines.
- Capture durable, reusable lessons from normal work (not one-off task logs).
- Save successful troubleshooting patterns and command sequences once they are verified.
- Include relevant rule/behavior updates from `.opencode/commands/rule.md` when they should guide future tasks.
- Capture user feedback and style nits when they are likely to repeat.
- When user critique identifies a miss, fix the current output first, then codify durable guidance in rules and lessons.
- Never store secrets, credentials, tokens, or sensitive environment details.
- Prefer generic phrasing that future agents can apply across similar tasks.
- Read lessons files early in each task before planning implementation details.
- Prune duplicates and stale bullets so signal stays high as work evolves.
